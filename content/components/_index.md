# Components

Adage is composed of modular infrastructure units â€” each component is a reusable building block deployable via configuration.

This section documents the core components available in the Adage system:

- Networking
- Identity & Access
- Storage
- Compute
- Serverless
- Orchestration

Each component defines its own inputs, dependencies, and runtime outputs.

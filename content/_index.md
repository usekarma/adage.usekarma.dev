# Adage

Infrastructure as consequence.  
A modular deployment framework for building systems that evolve from config — not code.

---

Adage is the foundation of the [Karma](https://usekarma.dev) system, enabling infrastructure that is:

- Config-first — deployments begin with declarative parameters
- Traceable — every change has a lineage and a reason
- Modular — reusable components deployed via dependency-aware logic
- Scalable — built for AWS multi-account, multi-environment systems

Whether you're deploying a static website, a Lambda function, or a graph of interconnected services — Adage treats each unit as a node in a live, introspectable system.

---

Built With:
- Terraform
- AWS Parameter Store
- Git + automation
